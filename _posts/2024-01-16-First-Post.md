Hello! If you are reading this you have landed on the 'preview' part of my website that provides short snippets (and links) to some of the other sections of my webpage. 

Think of the 'Home' page as a place to get a chronological categorization of projects, ideas and resources I come across and would like to document. 

I plan to use this page as a place for writing about innovative engineeing ideas, my own reflections about growing and developing myself as an engineer and resources for others that I find to be beneficial!

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
